        <h2>About Me:</h2>

        <img src="portrait_photo.jpg" alt="Picture of me." style="padding-left:12pt; float:right; width:200px; height:200px;">

        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I am a quantitative biologist with an interest in regenerative medicine and a belief that computation can help us better understand and predict biological systems. 
            I offer the ability to communicate computational and scientific ideas to varied audiences, scientific analysis skills, data manipulation, analysis, and visualization skills using Python, familiarity with experimental biology and the scientific method, and an enthusiasm for working with new kinds of data and new people to make a positive impact. 
            I have worked on projects from conception to publication, including experimental design and execution, organization and analysis of the resulting data using computational tools I wrote/designed, drawing of conclusions, and writing of peer-reviewed, published scientific articles. 
        </p>


        <h2>Research Interests:</h2>

        <p style="text-align:justify">
            How is a tissue built?
            How do cells integrate themselves into a tissue? 
            How do cells recognize and interpret the identity of another cell? 
            What are the stable states of a cell? Can a stability analysis be performed on a cell to determine if it will be 'happy' over a long period of time in a given environment (eg. if it has assimilated into a new tissue)?
            If you introduce a cell into a tissue, will it integrate? If not, why not? 
        </p>
