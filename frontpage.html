            <h2>About Me <!--This part seems like it would belong in the "About Me" section, move it there? Can I link to something on the same page?-->
            I am a scientist with an interest in the following questions:
            How is a tissue built?
            How do cells integrate themselves into a tissue?
            How do cells recognize and interpret the identity of another cell?
            What are the stable states of a cell? Can a stability analysis be performed on a cell to determine if it will be 'happy' over a long period of time in a given environment (eg. if it has assimilated into a new tissue)?
            If you introduce a cell into a tissue, will it integrate? If not, why not?
            I enjoy making things, whether they be large imaging datasets, 3D models, code and algorithms, graphs, or figures for papers. 
            My dream is to be able to make cells and tissues with a specific function or purpose that integrate themselves with into an organism.
