            I am a scientist with an interest in the following questions:
            How is a tissue built?
            How do cells integrate themselves into a tissue?
            How do cells recognize and interpret the identity of another cell?
            What are the stable states of a cell? Can a stability analysis be performed on a cell to determine if it will be 'happy' over a long period of time in a given environment (eg. if it has assimilated into a new tissue)?
            If you introduce a cell into a tissue, will it integrate? If not, why not?
